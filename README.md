# Disclaimer

This project is quite broken right now. You can explore it, and it should compile and run ok for the most part, but it's pretty broken and I'm not planning on working on it for awhile.

# Cocoa Engine
Welcome to Cocoa Engine, this is a 2D game engine independently developed by me, Gabe Ambrosio (AKA GamesWithGabe).  The engine is currently in development, for the most recent stable build please follow the following steps on the *master* branch. 

## Quickstart
In order to run this, you'll have to run a few commands. First, open up a powershell window in a directory you would like to contain the engine source code. (The engine currently only supports Windows, so this will not work on Linux *yet*).

Next run these commands:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ambrosiogabe/Cocoa
cd Cocoa
build.bat vs2019
```

These commands will clone the repository into your directory, update the submodules (this step takes awhile because of all the code). 

Next, build freetype by doing:

```
cd CocoaEngine\vendor\freetypeVendor
mkdir freetype2.compiled
cd freetype2.compiled
cmake ..
```

You'll also have to build it in the VS solution file.

After that, simply double click the VisualStudio solution file that was (hopefully) generated, and then once it opens press F5 to run. This will compile *almost* all the projects, unfortunately I can't get FreeType to build in order ***yet***. So, for now, the build will fail the first time, then just right-click the ```freetype``` project in the right-hand panel in visual studio and click ```build```.

</details>

If all this works properly, you should be able to press F5 once again and then be presented with a window saying to create a project or open a Cocoa project.

***NOTE***: This only works with VisualStudio 2019 right now, I will add support for more versions and more editor hopefully in the near future.
